# Hello-World
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Crystal and I used to work for Pizza Hut. I am trying a new career that will enable me to build websites, code apps for andriod and apple systems, and gain the knowledge that is offered in this class. I am eager to learn and I am sure I will make some mistakes but I will overcome them with practice and gained knowledge.
